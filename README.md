# Droid Emmoder (WIP)

_Emmoder_ pronounced `\ɑ̃.mɔ.de\` means _to initiate_, _to set in motion_, _to start_ in Swiss-French patois.

It's a performance sequencer build around the [Droid universal CV processor](https://shop.dermannmitdermaschine.de/pages/droid-universal-cv-processor).

Parts of the code are inspired by [Mathias Kettner](https://dmmdm.de/) Droid exemples.
